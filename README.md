# pcg-python

This is an early attempt at wrapping the 
[pcg random number generator](http://www.pcg-random.org/) 
for use in Python and Numpy. It uses source from 
[pcg](http://www.pcg-random.org/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and 
[randomkit](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/random/mtrand/).

## Status
Currently only some core RNGs are available: uniform [0,1), standard normal,
standard gamma, standard exponential and 32-bit unsigned integers.

The generators all return 1-d arrays.

Alternative streams can be generated by setting the initial state and increment 
when initialize the object, or when using `seed`.

The advance function has been implemented, see `advance`.

There is no documentation.

## Plans
There are still many improvements needed before this is really usable. 

At a minimum this needs to support:

  * More critical RNGs
  * Ability to return other shapes
  * Default arguments
  * Entropy based initialization

## Requirements
Requires (Built Using):

  * Numpy (1.10)
  * Cython (0.23)
 
So far all development has been on Linux, so other platforms might not work.
 

## Building
So far I have only experimented with in-place building.

```bash
cd pcg
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

## Using

```python
import pcg

rs = pcg.PCGRandomState()
rs.standard_normal(100)
```

Standard NCSA, plus sub licenses for components.
